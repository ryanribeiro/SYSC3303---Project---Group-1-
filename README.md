## Changes that were made since the previous deliverable
1. `PolarCoordinateDistanceMetric` which implements `DistanceMetric` interface was added to calculate the distance between two polar coordinates.
2. User can use a string as the value of a feature. `DataPrep` class was added to take care of converting the string values to number and vice versa. 
3. GUI now handles adding complex feature.
